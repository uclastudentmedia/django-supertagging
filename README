Django SuperTagging

Inspired by django-tagging, this project came up when we wanted to
automate content tagging. Using OpenCalais service we are able to retrieve
a large array of data, including basic entities (tags) and relations (attributes
about the tag).

Prerequisites
	- simplejson ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson )
	- python-calais from this branch ( https://code.launchpad.net/~yml/python-calais/with_setup )
	This branch fix a unicode issue in the original version ( http://code.google.com/p/python-calais )
